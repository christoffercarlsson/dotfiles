# dotfiles

Configuration files and scripts for my development environment on macOS & Linux.

## How to install

Open a terminal and run the commands below.

### Step 1 - Install Homebrew (macOS only)

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is an easy and flexible way to install the UNIX tools Apple didnâ€™t include with macOS.

Install Homebrew by running the following command:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Once the installation is done, follow the given *Next steps* instructions.

### Step 2 - Install dotfiles

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/christoffercarlsson/dotfiles/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

**Warning:** Running the command above may overwrite your existing configuration files.

### Step 3 - Reboot your system

After you've run the commands listed above, reboot your system for all changes takes effect.

### Step 4 - Enter your Git credentials

Once you've restarted your system, open a terminal and run the following command to configure your Git credentials:

```bash
set-git-author
```

Enter the name and email address that you want to associate your Git commits with. The script will then attempt to import your PGP public key from a keyserver automatically based on your email address (if your public key is not found on a keyserver you'll need to import it manually).

### Step 5 - Install Node Version Manager (optional)

The [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (NVM) allows you to quickly install and use different versions of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) via the command line.

Install the latest version of NVM by running the following command:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/HEAD/install.sh | bash
```
